voce theme for Pelican
======================

[voce](https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce) is a responsive theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). It was templated on [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/gfidente/pelican-svbhack) by [Giulio Fidente](https://github.com/giulivo). It is lightweight and suitable for text heavy articles.


## Demo

## Installing

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce) (ex: `git clone https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce`)
2. Clone the [pelican-plugins repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) (ex: `git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins`)
2. Install python dependencies (ex: `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Modify the the following variables in `pelicanconf.py`. Make sure that PLUGIN_PATHS points to the cloned pelican-plugins repository and THEME points to the cloned theme.

PLUGINS = ['assets']
THEME = './themes/voce/'
```

## pelicanconf.py

This theme supports a number of custom variables:

- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`: Your Google Analytics UA-XXXXXXXX-X code (`None` to disable analytics).
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROP`: Your Google Analytics property name (`None` to disable analytics).
- `USER_LOGO_URL`: The image to display in the center of the page. Can be local or a remote URL.
- `MANGLE_EMAILS`: If enabled, any emails in the `SOCIAL` or `LINKS` lists will be obfuscated in HTML and have their links generated by Javascript when the page loads.
- `GLOBAL_KEYWORDS`: A list of strings that will be set as meta keywords for each page.
- `FUZZY_DATES`: If `True`, uses [lw-timeago](https://github.com/pR0Ps/lw-timeago) to display fuzzy dates on articles (eg. 'Posted 3 months ago').

The following variables are required in pelicanconf.py to display the submenu with article categories. 

- TAGS_URL = 'tags.html'
- ARCHIVES_URL = 'archives.html'
  
### Sample Links and Social Widget  
LINKS = (('Home','/index.html'),  
     ('About','/pages/about.html'),)  
  
SOCIAL = (('Feed','/feeds/all.atom.xml'),  
      ('Email','mailto:xxx@gmail.com'),  
      ('GitHub','http://github.com/limbenjamin'),)  
  
### Social Icons
  
voce uses social icons from font-awesome. To customise the icons, you will need to edit base.html. Change the link to the domain you wish to link to and look up the class name from [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).  
  
{% elif temp.startswith('mailto:') %}{% set class = 'fa-envelope' %}   
{% elif temp.startswith('facebook.com') %}{% set class = 'fa-facebook' %}  
{% elif temp.startswith('flickr.com') %}{% set class = 'fa-flickr' %}
